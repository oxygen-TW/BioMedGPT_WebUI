I understand that you cannot provide opinions,nor suggest, any type of therpy. . My son (dob-[DATE]), was called back to the hospital four days after birth due to a abnormal PKU, which suggested adrenal hyperplasia.

His MIGB clearly showed bifocal uptake in both adrenal glands. The mri did not show tumors at that time ([DATE].
